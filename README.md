# StringCalculator Kata In C#

This repository stores the sample project I use in the "TDD in C#: The Step-By-Step Process" blog post for the CoScreen blog.

The `main` branch contains the starting point, so readers can follow allong the tutorial.

The `finished-kata` branch has the complete solution for the [StringCalculator](https://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1) Kata proposed by Roy Osherov. Each commit represents a step in the TDD cycle.
